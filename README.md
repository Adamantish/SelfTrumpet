# Backbone Portfolio

Brings together nearly all the technologies learned during the We Got Coders course.
 - Rails + Postgres on the back.
 - Jquery + Backbone + SCSS on the front.
 - Using JSON APIs (github)
 - Uses RESTful JSON API in Sinatra. (Packaged into a gem in my repo named Follower)
 - Rspec, Jasmine, Cucumber, Capybara, VCR, PhantomJS for testing.

 Includes a module called Editable I came up with for simplifying the creation of edit-in-place forms.
